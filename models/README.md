# Explanation of my BaseModel

The class has the following public instance attributes:

id: This is a string that is assigned a unique identifier (UUID) when an instance of BaseModel is created. This is done by using the uuid.uuid4() function from the uuid module and converting the resulting UUID to a string. The goal is to ensure that each instance of BaseModel has a unique identifier.

created_at: This is a datetime object that is assigned the current date and time when an instance of BaseModel is created.

updated_at: This is a datetime object that is assigned the current date and time when an instance of BaseModel is created and is updated every time the object is changed.

The class has the following public instance methods:

save(self): This method updates the updated_at attribute of the instance with the current date and time. This is useful for keeping track of when the instance was last modified.

to_dict(self): This method returns a dictionary representation of the instance. The dictionary contains all the keys and values of the __dict__ attribute of the instance. The only addition to this dictionary is a key __class__ with the class name of the object. The created_at and updated_at attributes are also converted to string objects in ISO format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f). This method is the first step in the serialization/deserialization process, as it creates a dictionary representation with "simple object types" of the BaseModel instance.

The class also has the following special method:

__str__(self): This method returns a string representation of the instance. The string contains the class name (obtained through self.__class__.__name__), the instance ID (self.id), and the string representation of the __dict__ attribute of the instance (self.__dict__). This method is used when trying to print an instance of the BaseModel class or when using the str() function on an instance of the class.
