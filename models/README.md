# My Base Model from which all other clases will inherit 

The BaseModel class is a master class that defines common attributes and methods for other classes to inherit from. It is meant to be used as a starting point for creating more specialized classes, while providing a basic set of functionalities that are shared across all classes.

The code implements a class FileStorage that provides methods to store and retrieve objects from a file in JSON format. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to persist objects between program runs.

Here's a detailed explanation of each method in the FileStorage class:

all: This method returns the __objects dictionary, which is a class attribute that stores all the objects that have been added to the storage. The __objects dictionary is a mapping of object keys (generated from the class name and object ID) to the objects themselves.

new: This method adds a new object to the __objects dictionary. The key for the object is generated by concatenating the name of the object's class and its ID, separated by a period.

save: This method serializes the __objects dictionary to a JSON file specified by the __file_path class attribute. It does this by creating an empty dictionary sdict, and then iterating over the __objects dictionary and adding each object to sdict after converting it to a dictionary using the to_dict method. Finally, the json.dump function is used to write the contents of sdict to the file.

reload: This method retrieves the objects from the JSON file specified by the __file_path class attribute and adds them back to the __objects dictionary. It does this by using the json.load function to parse the contents of the file, and then iterating over the resulting dictionary and creating objects of the appropriate type based on the value of the __class__ key. The objects are then added to the __objects dictionary using the object key generated in the same way as in the new method. The method uses a try-except block to handle the case where the file does not exist, in which case it does nothing.

Overall, the FileStorage class provides a simple and convenient way to store and retrieve objects to and from a file, allowing objects to persist across program runs.
